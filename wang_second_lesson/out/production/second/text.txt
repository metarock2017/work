 We are all in the position of the farmer If we plant a good seed we reap a good harvest If our seed
 is poor and full of weeds we reap a useless crop If we plant nothing at all we harvest nothing at all I
want the future to be better than the past I do not want it contaminated by the mistakes and errors
with which history is filled We should all be concerned about the future because that is where we
will spend the remainder of our lives
